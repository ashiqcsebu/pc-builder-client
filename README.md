### About the project

1. Home Page:
When a user enters the application, they will be greeted with a captivating home page featuring a sliding image banner. Below the banner, there will be a section showcasing featured items from various categories. The home page will also include a footer for easy navigation.

2. Featured Page:
The navigation bar will provide a link to the featured page, where users can explore a comprehensive list of item categories. From here, they can access individual category pages to view specific items within each category.

3. Category Pages:
Additionally, users can easily access specific categories directly from the navbar menu. Each category page will display a list of items relevant to the selected category.

4. NextAuth Integration:
For enhanced security and personalized features, we have integrated NextAuth into the application. Users will need to log in using their Google or GitHub accounts to access certain protected pages, such as the PC Builder page.

5. PC Builder Page:
Once logged in, users can access the PC Builder page, where they can assemble their dream PC. Each category will have a selection of products, and users can add items to their build. The selected items will be displayed in a table format on the page. When the user has chosen the required components, the "Complete Build" button will be enabled. Clicking the button will trigger an alert confirming the addition to the cart, and the page will refresh for a seamless experience.
